# IMTC 505 Lab 1 (Brock Legentil 21645577)

## Overview/Criteria
Within this lab we were tasked with creating using the provided unitypackage to create a mini game with some added features and additional assets. Specifically:
 - At least three additional assets/models/images included in the scene
 - Two different behaviours
 - Behaviours added to all point objects
 - Behaviours added to at least 3 environment objects

## Added Behaivours
The behaviours I added within my scene were:
 - A script to have objects hover up and down slowly
 - A script that changes the color of an asset based off distance from the player
 - A script that increases the rotation of an asset based of the number of points collected, starting from no rotation

Within my scene, I added the first two behaviours to all the point objects, and I added the third behaivour to the 5 different (4 unique) added tree assets that I acquired through the unity store
